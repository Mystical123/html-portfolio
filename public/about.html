<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently attending Sacramento State as a computer science major and have a strong passion for technology as well as software.
  My favorite tech brand would be Apple. My goals for the future are to be a software engineer in the bay area or Seattle and even Los Angeles area.
</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include hiking, traveling, sports, video games, and playing an instrument. My favorite thing to do is to
  hang out with my friends and discuss our future paths of where we want to take ourselves in the future. I also have a small passion for cooking on
  the side whenever I am bored and want to make a new dish to fulfill my needs. 
</p>

<p>Some goals I have for myself is to move to SoCal and own a big mansion on the side of the hills with a great car collection including the gt3 turbo s and rs.
  Another goal of mine is having the financial freedom to travel the world and experience different cultures and environemnts where I can learn
  important lessons and create new bonds. Some of my most fond memories come from meeting new people usually across the globe and bonding with them
  in such short periods of time as if I knew them for since childhood.
